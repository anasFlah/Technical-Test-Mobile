////////////////////////////////// Task2 ////////////////////////////////
// Given an array of positive integers (the tall of the people), return a new array/tuple of two integers, 
// where the first one is the total height of team 1, and the second one is the total height of team 2.

// Several people are standing in a row divided into two teams.
// The first person goes into team 1, the second goes into team 2, the third goes into team 1, and so on.

// Explanation:
// The first element 380 is the total height of team 1, and the second element 180 is the total weight of team 2.


// test Output
// rowheights([170, 180, 210])  ==>  return (380, 180)
// rowheights([150, 160, 170, 180])  ==>  return (320, 340)
// rowheights([190]) ==> return (190,0)







List<int> rowHeights(arr) {
