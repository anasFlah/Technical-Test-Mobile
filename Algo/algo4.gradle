/////////////////////// task 4 //////////////////////
// You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more,
//  is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

// However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things!
//  If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! 
// That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.
// Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:
// Test Output
// -1  =>  false
//  0  =>  true
//  3  =>  false
//  4  =>  true
// 25  =>  true
// 26  =>  false

isSquare(n) { 
  return false; // Fix me!
}
