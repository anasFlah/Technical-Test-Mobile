# Futter is a cross-platform development framework that allows developers to create apps across iOS, 
# Android, web, and MacOS by writing code only once. The beauty of Flutter is that it renders a native 
# look and feel in each app by drawing the UI from scratch, rather than acting as a wrapper.
 # This open-source framework developed by Google can be a lifesaver for 
# companies who want to develop multi-platform apps on a limited budget or time that are also easy to maintain .
